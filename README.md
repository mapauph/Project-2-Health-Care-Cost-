### Introduction
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of healthcare costs using linear regression models. The increasing importance of understanding and forecasting costs associated with an individual's health has driven the application of advanced analytical techniques in the healthcare field. In this context, relevant data were explored to identify patterns and relationships that allow estimating an individual's potential health cost based on various characteristics.

## Project Contents

### Dataset
A dataset containing information about individuals was used, with a specific focus on five key variables: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of children, and health care costs. This dataset encompassed information from 1338 patients, providing a robust foundation for analysis.

### Exploratory Analysis
An exploratory analysis was conducted to understand the distribution of variables and their preliminary relationships. This provided an overview of the data and helped identify potential areas of focus.

### Linear Regression Modeling
A linear regression model was implemented to predict healthcare costs based on the selected variables. This approach allows establishing a linear relationship between an individual's characteristics and their associated health costs.

### Significant Variables
During the modeling process, it was identified that the most relevant variables for predicting healthcare costs were smoking habits and body mass index (BMI). These variables demonstrated a significant influence on the estimation of an individual's health costs.

## Case Evaluations
Specific evaluations were conducted for two particular cases: the first involving "Zuko" and the second involving "Azula." These cases were selected to illustrate how the model can predict the healthcare costs of specific individuals based on their personal characteristics.

## Results
The results of the case evaluations provide a detailed insight into how the linear regression model estimates healthcare costs for Zuko and Azula, highlighting the importance of key variables in the prediction.

#### Zukko's Health Care Cost Estimate

- **Gender:** Male
- **Smoking Habit:** Yes
- **Area:** Southeast
- **Age:** 25
- **BMI (Body Mass Index):** 30.5
- **Number of Children:** 2

**Estimated Health Care Cost for Zukko:** $34,180.64

#### Azula's Health Care Cost Estimate

- **Gender:** Female
- **Smoking Habit:** No
- **Area:** Southeast
- **Age:** 45
- **BMI (Body Mass Index):** 19
- **Number of Children:** 0

**Estimated Health Care Cost for Azula:** $15,988.76

*Note: Zuko and Azula are fictitious individuals created for testing the model.*

## Conclusion
This project offers a detailed perspective on the analysis and prediction of healthcare costs using linear regression models. The identification of influential variables such as smoking habits and BMI underscores the relevance of these factors in estimating healthcare costs. The results of the case evaluations provide specific information about the practical application of the model in individual scenarios, such as the cases of Zuko and Azula.
